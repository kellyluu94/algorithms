// Brute force. Write a program BruteCollinearPoints.java that examines 4 points at a time and checks whether they all lie on the same line segment, returning all such line segments. To check whether the 4 points p, q, r, and s are collinear, check whether the three slopes between p and q, between p and r, and between p and s are all equal.

public class BruteCollinearPoints {
   public BruteCollinearPoints(Point[] points)    // finds all line segments containing 4 points
   public           int numberOfSegments()        // the number of line segments
   public LineSegment[] segments()                // the line segments
}

// The method segments() should include each line segment containing 4 points exactly once. If 4 points appear on a line segment in the order p→q→r→s, then you should include either the line segment p→s or s→p (but not both) and you should not include subsegments such as p→r or q→r. For simplicity, we will not supply any input to BruteCollinearPoints that has 5 or more collinear points.

// Corner cases. Throw an IllegalArgumentException if the argument to the constructor is null, if any point in the array is null, or if the argument to the constructor contains a repeated point.

// Performance requirement. The order of growth of the running time of your program should be n4 in the worst case and it should use space proportional to n plus the number of line segments returned.
