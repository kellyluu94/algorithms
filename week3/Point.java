// To get started, use the data type Point.java, which implements the constructor and the draw(), drawTo(), and toString() methods. Your job is to add the following components.
// The compareTo() method should compare points by their y-coordinates, breaking ties by their x-coordinates. Formally, the invoking point (x0, y0) is less than the argument point (x1, y1) if and only if either y0 < y1 or if y0 = y1 and x0 < x1.
// The slopeTo() method should return the slope between the invoking point (x0, y0) and the argument point (x1, y1), which is given by the formula (y1 − y0) / (x1 − x0). Treat the slope of a horizontal line segment as positive zero; treat the slope of a vertical line segment as positive infinity; treat the slope of a degenerate line segment (between a point and itself) as negative infinity.
// The slopeOrder() method should return a comparator that compares its two argument points by the slopes they make with the invoking point (x0, y0). Formally, the point (x1, y1) is less than the point (x2, y2) if and only if the slope (y1 − y0) / (x1 − x0) is less than the slope (y2 − y0) / (x2 − x0). Treat horizontal, vertical, and degenerate line segments as in the slopeTo() method.
// Do not override the equals() or hashCode() methods.
// Corner cases. To avoid potential complications with integer overflow or floating-point precision, you may assume that the constructor arguments x and y are each between 0 and 32,767.
